# 🧬 Fertility Diagnosis Prediction

Welcome to the **Fertility Diagnosis Prediction** project! This repository contains the code and data analysis for predicting fertility diagnoses based on various health metrics.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `dataset.py`: Script for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- `fertility_Diagnosis.txt`: Raw dataset file containing health metrics and corresponding fertility diagnoses.
- `data_quality_report_clinic_table.pdf`: Report assessing the quality of the clinic data.
- `detailed_data_quality_report.pdf`: Comprehensive data quality report with in-depth analysis.
- `Preliminary-2020-National-Summary-Clinic-Table.xlsx`: Preliminary national summary data from 2020 for clinic statistics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/simonemayers/CSCI6020-term-project.git
   cd CSCI6020-term-project
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the data preprocessing script**:
   ```bash
   python dataset.py
   ```

## 📊 Data Overview

The dataset includes various health metrics used to predict fertility diagnoses. For detailed information about the data quality and preprocessing steps, refer to the following reports:
